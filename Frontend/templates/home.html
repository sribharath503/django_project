    <p>
      Our billing system provides a seamless way to manage your <strong>products, customers, and orders</strong> all in one place. It’s designed to help businesses handle day-to-day transactions with accuracy and speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the <strong>Products</strong> section, you can add, update, and view details about the items you sell, including price and tax information (GST). This ensures that each product is tracked correctly throughout the order process.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>Customers</strong> section allows you to manage your customer database — whether you’re onboarding a new customer or updating contact information for existing clients. All customer details are securely maintained for smooth order tracking and billing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the <strong>Order Management</strong> module, you can create new orders by selecting available products and customers, automatically calculate GST and total billing amounts, and monitor all purchase histories in a structured format.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you're a small retailer or managing bulk orders, this platform simplifies your billing process, improves transparency, and helps you stay organized.
